  ## 1.0.1 Release Notes

  ðŸ”„ **Refactor & Cleanup**
  - Migrated to a local Metrics class under the package `team.kitemc.verifymc` to avoid conflicts with bStats dependencies.
  - Removed all bStats dependencies from the project.
  - Now Metrics can be used safely without any external dependency or classpath conflict.
