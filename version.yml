  ## 1.0.2 Release Notes

  🛡️ **Whitelist Logic Fix**
  - Reapplied: In plugin whitelist mode, the check is now based on player name (id) instead of UUID.
  - This improves compatibility for offline servers and avoids UUID mismatch issues.
  - Note: Ensure player names are unique and case-insensitive. If a player changes their name, the whitelist must be updated manually.
